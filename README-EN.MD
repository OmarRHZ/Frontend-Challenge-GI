# 🌿 Frontend Challenge: Dashboard Redesign

Welcome to the Emissions Dashboard Redesign Challenge!  
We have an initial functional version of the dashboard that displays greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from 2021 to 2022. However, the visual appearance is still quite basic, and we want you — as a frontend developer — to help us take it to the next level 💡.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

We currently have a **dashboard** that visualizes key information such as:

- Total GHG emissions by year  
- Percentage and absolute reduction  
- Emissions by source and by scope (Scope 1, 2, 3)  
- Core indicator scenarios through 2030  

📌 You can view the initial version of the dashboard here:

## 🧩 Your Mission

Your goal is to redesign this dashboard so that it:

- Has strong visual impact for new users  
- Can scale to support **more years** and **more emission sources** (e.g., transportation, electricity, water, etc.)  
- Is easy to read and navigate  
- Works well across different screen sizes (responsive)  
- Follows accessibility best practices  

**It must be built using React**

## 🛠️ How to Participate

1. Create a new project where you redesign the dashboard.  
2. Use static/mock data or extract the data shown in the image.  
3. Upload your project to GitHub.  
4. Document your solution with a brief technical explanation in the README — include which libraries you used and why.  
5. Share your GitHub repository link with us via email at **contact@greeninitiative.eco**.

## 💡 Recommendations

- Consider using libraries like Chart.js, Recharts, D3.js, Highcharts, or similar for charts.  
- Create a visual identity using a design system (color palette, typography, spacing).  
- Use nature-inspired colors (green tones).  
- Think about how to scale the visualizations to **more sources** and **more years** without overwhelming the user.  
- You’re free to add any charts or visual elements you see fit.  

---

## 📜 Rules

- The redesign must be original.  
- You may reuse components if you're using a UI framework (e.g., Ant Design, Tailwind, Chakra UI, Shadcn).  
- Your solution must be runnable locally.  
- This version does **not** need to be responsive.  
- While you can be inspired by the current version, **creative redesigns are highly encouraged**.

We look forward to seeing your creativity in action! 🚀🌍
